= openCypher website

This repository hosts the content of the website link:www.opencypher.org[http://www.opencypher.org].

=== Build

The live build may be monitored at this page: https://app.snap-ci.com/opencypher/website/branch/master

The build system is monitored at this page: http://status.snap-ci.com/

Please note that if the build system is malfunctioning, it doesn't appear to retroactively rebuild the page, but new pushes are necessary (even with the same content).

To build and deploy locally, simply run:

----
jekyll serve --watch
----

This will deploy the webserver and serve the website at `localhost:4000` (by default).
